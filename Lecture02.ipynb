    "UMBC is often criticized by its own students for a perceived lack of student life and for a campus that falls silent after 5 p.m. For a new student or a new resident, it can be challenging to explore, let alone locate, the campus culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential first step in immersing yourself in UMBC doesn’t even require leaving your bedroom. UMBC may get quiet in the evenings, but that’s when UMBC Twitter gets loud. Between professors, departments and students themselves, UMBC has a vibrant Twitter community. If you’re new to UMBC or you’re just looking to get a little more involved, Twitter is an excellent place to start. Below, in no particular order, are fifteen accounts you should start with. Give them a follow and you might find yourself feeling a little more connected to your university.\n",

You don’t have to schedule a mock interview or bring your resume in for approval to take advantage of the career experts at UMBC. You should probably do those things, especially you second-semester seniors, but giving them a follow on Twitter is a good move too. Their tweets will give you interview tips, resume recommendations, and job and internship leads.\n",

    "3. UMBC SGA (@umbcsga)\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a lot of skepticism about the effectiveness and the integrity of UMBC’s Student Government Association in recent years, and not without reason. For many students, the scandal and trial defined Anthony Jankoski’s 2015-16 presidency. As a result, students lost faith and interest in the SGA. If you’re looking to see a better side of SGA, this account is a must-follow. Presumably looking to improve their transparency, SGA has tweeted details about Senate meetings, swearings-in, and the best events on campus.\n",
